# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_Project

<p>Un this project, the analysis will focus on using Natural Language techniques to find broad trends in the written thoughts of the customers.
The goal in this project is to predict whether customers recommend the product they purchased using the information in their review text.
One of the challenges in this project is to extract useful information from the *Review Text* variable using text mining techniques. The other challenge is the need to convert text files into numeric feature vectors to run machine learning algorithms.
At the end of this project, I built sentiment classification models using Machine Learning algorithms (***Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest*** and ***Ada Boosting***), **Deep Learning algorithms** and **BERT algorithm**.</p>
The data is a collection of 22641 Rows and 10 column variables. Each row includes a written comment as well as additional customer information.
Also each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:

---
The basic goal in this project is to predict whether customers recommend the product they purchased using the information in their *Review Text*.
Especially, it should be noted that the expectation in this project is to use only the "Review Text" variable and neglect the other ones.
Of course, if you want, you can work on other variables individually.

## The features in the given dataset are:

-<b>Clothing ID:</b> Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.
-<b>Age:</b> Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.
-<b>Age:</b> Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.
-<b>Title:</b> String variable for the title of the review.
-<b>Review Text:</b> String variable for the review body.
-<b>Rating:</b> Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best.
-<b>Recommended IND:</b> Binary variable stating where the customer recommends the product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.
-<b>Positive Feedback Count:</b> Positive Integer documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.
-<b>Division Name:</b> Categorical name of the product high level division.
-<b>Department Name:</b> Categorical name of the product department name.
-<b>Class Name:</b> Categorical name of the product class name.
